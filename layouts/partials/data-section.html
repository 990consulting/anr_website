				<p>Nonprofits must disclose many sensitive business details, including revenues, expenses, and compensation data. Nonprofits, which compete with small business for talent and dollars, reveal key insights about the climate of small business in the U.S.</p>
				<p>Applied Nonprofit Researchâ€™s founders have revolutionized access to nonprofit data. As Director of Data Science at Charity Navigator, David Borenstein created open-source tools to democratize electronic IRS 990 forms.</p>
				<h2 class="font-purple">Those tools power Open990.com, a free searchable database of charities, private foundations, and other nonprofits. We make 990 datasets available for free as spreadsheets on Amazon Web Services.</h2>
